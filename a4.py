def songs_in(m):
    """Returns: sorted list of all *distinct* Songs that can be reached by
    tracing through the contents of `m`.

    Two Songs count as non-distinct if they have the same title and artist.

    `m` itself should remain unchanged.

    Examples:
        Suppose we had a Mix whose contents was [a4_test.llee, a4_test.weird].

        The `llee` Mix contains, using the variable names from a4_test.py,
           s_ba, s_ds, s_np, s_dyc, s_lme .
        The `weird` Mix can be worked out to contain
            s_ttabeftbou, s_r, s_batj, s_br, s_tmbtp, s_pk, s_gib, s_oial,
            s_bdth, s_tmbtp2, s_bdth2, s_dyc, s_lme
        There are two Songs in common: s_dyc and s_lme.

        The result should be (since the default sort order for Songs is by
        artist, then title) the list of the following Songs, in this order:

            s_r:    Song 'Redbone' by Childish Gambino
            s_batj: Song 'Bennie and the Jets' by Elton John

            s_lme:  'Losing My Edge' by LCD Soundsystem
            s_ds:   'Divorce Song' by Liz Phair
            s_np    'Nana Party (Chuang 2021 live version)' by OJM [et al.]
            s_br:   'Bohemian Rhapsody' by Queen
            s_ba:   'Broken Arrow' by Robbie Robertson
            s_ttabeftbou: 'This Town Ainâ€™t Big Enough for the Both of Us' by Sparks
            s_bdth: 'Burning Down the House' by Talking Heads

            s_oial: 'Once in a lifetime' by Talking Heads
            s_pk:   'Psycho Killer' by Talking Heads
            s_tmbtp:'This must be the place' by Talking Heads
